//1.  String Concatenation

let name = "tara"
let number = 12

// console.log(name+number);
// console.log(name+number+ "value");
// This is outdated now...

// 2.  backticks - ` ` ..... it is used to concate many words like..my name is tara, i am 19 years old... so 
// we dont need to Add + sign again and again!!!

// console.log(`my name is tara, i am 19 years old`); 

// suppose u have to use declared variables in this format

console.log(`my name is ${name} and i am ${number} years old `);
